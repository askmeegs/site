I don't do a lot of (read: any) machine learning in my current role, which is focused on systems infrastructure. But interestingly, I sort of have to be conversant in machine learning (applications, trends, who uses what to do what and why, etc.) in order to help make sure the stuff my team builds is relevant. *ie.* "I don't need to use this but I need to know it."

I have a past life as an undergrad machine learning-esque person that was less math, more "sitting in a a proverbial dumpster full of data and trying to do something with it." Math and I don't always get along- and so my subject knowledge is basically a doily consisting of many gaps (math.) but also a few things I know *really* well. Like how to clean up CSVs. Or K-nearest-neighbors.

And so I'm working on trying to fill in this ML doily, especially for re-learning neural nets and getting hands-on with models (versus spending all my time tinkering with the data). Thankfully, there is [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to help! 

Today was day zero (estimators! deep neural networks! tensors! python!?) and you can check out my notes [here](https://github.com/m-okeefe/tf-notes/blob/master/Part%201%20-%20Iris%20Data%20Tutorial.ipynb) -- just a broken-down version of the tutorial code with some annotations. :)
