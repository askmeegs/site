At work, I spend a lot of time with APIs -- using them, building them. The [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) editor is familiar. JSON is comfortable. I know what `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` do.

But lately I've found myself wondering if I'm doing APIs "right." What does it mean to have a "good" API?

This quest for information brought me  all around the Web, and I was able to learn about lot of new stuff. Like [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)!

Turns out there are a ton of [great](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/32713.pdf) [guides](http://101.apievangelist.com/) out there about API design. I made some slides that helped me synthesize some of my thoughts about different API styles, and also pare down to what I saw as the top 5 API design principles.
