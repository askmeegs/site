Hello (extremely small population on extremely small) world! Thank you for stopping by. Hello.

I have had a blog in the past. I have deleted said blog, not just `delete repo` but also `delete from the universe.` A fresh start it is. Who doesn't love a fresh start.

The contents of this new blog ðŸŽ‰ are TBD, but I am a person who spends most of their time 1) doing tech things and 2) writing not tech things, so my guess is that the blog will span... that.

Welcome- stay tuned- forgive me- world!
